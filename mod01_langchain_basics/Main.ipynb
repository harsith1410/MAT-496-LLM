      "**Short answer:**  \n",
      "If you’re asking which car has been the *most dominant* in F1 history, the 1988 **McLaren‑Honda MP4/4** is the clear front‑runner – it won every single race it entered that season (16/16).  In the present day the 2023 **Red Bull‑Honda RB19** is the undisputed “best” car on the grid, having won 21 of 25 races and setting a new record for consecutive victories.\n",

      "| Year | Car | Wins | Wins per race | Notes |\n",
      "|------|-----|------|---------------|-------|\n",
      "| 1988 | McLaren‑Honda MP4/4 | 16 | 1.00 | 100 % win rate, 12‑point advantage over the nearest rival, 8‑point gap to the second‑place driver (Alain Prost) |\n",
      "| 1992 | Williams‑Honda FW14B | 10 | 0.625 | First fully‑active suspension car; still the most advanced tech of its era |\n",
      "| 2004 | Ferrari F2004 | 15 | 0.833 | Dominated the “shark‑nose” era; 15/18 wins |\n",
      "| 2023 | Red Bull‑Honda RB19 | 21 | 0.84 | 21/25 wins, 12‑point gap to second‑place driver (Max Verstappen) |\n",
      "\n",
      "The MP4/4’s 100 % win rate is the only one that still stands out in that regard.  It was a perfect synthesis of power, aerodynamics, and reliability, and it made the 1988 season a textbook case of domination.\n",

      "- **Power unit** – The 2023‑style 1.6 L V6 turbo‑charged hybrid has a peak output of ~1,100 hp (power‑unit + MGU‑K).  \n",
      "- **Aerodynamics** – A highly efficient ground‑effect under‑body, a low‑profile front wing, and a “single‑diffuser” design that gives the car a huge downforce margin.  \n",
      "- **Reliability** – 21 wins out of 25 races, only one retirement.  \n",
      "- **Driver synergy** – Max Verstappen’s driving style is a perfect match for the car’s power delivery and aero characteristics.  \n",

      "- **Current “best” car:** *Red Bull‑Honda RB19* (2023).  \n",
      "- **Future “best” car:** The answer will depend on how the next generation of regulations (safety‑car rules, power‑unit limits, aerodynamic “safety” zones) shape the design.  Red Bull and Mercedes are the front‑runners, but Ferrari’s new concept may surprise us.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re looking for a single car that combines dominance, innovation, and legacy, the **McLaren‑MP4/4** is the textbook example.  If you’re asking about the present moment, the **RB19** is the one to watch.  The next decade will likely see a new champion, but it will almost certainly come from Red Bull or Mercedes.\n"
